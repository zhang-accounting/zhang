## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of your Astro + Starlight project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
.
├── public/
├── src/
│   ├── assets/
│   ├── content/
│   │   ├── docs/
│   │   └── config.ts
│   └── env.d.ts
├── astro.config.mjs
├── package.json
└── tsconfig.json
```

Starlight looks for `.md` or `.mdx` files in the `src/content/docs/` directory. Each file is exposed as a route based on its file name.

Images can be added to `src/assets/` and embedded in Markdown with a relative link.

Static assets, like favicons, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
| :------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------- |
| `npm install`             | Installs dependencies                            |
| `npm run dev`             | Starts local dev server at `localhost:4321`      |
| `npm run build`           | Build your production site to `./dist/`          |
| `npm run preview`         | Preview your build locally, before deploying     |

## Deploying to Cloudflare Workers

This documentation site is configured to be deployed to Cloudflare Workers. The deployment happens automatically via GitHub Actions when changes are pushed to the `main` or `develop` branches.

### GitHub Secrets Required

To enable automatic deployment, add the following secrets to your GitHub repository:

- `CF_API_TOKEN`: Cloudflare API token with Workers and Pages permissions
- `CF_ACCOUNT_ID`: Your Cloudflare account ID

### Manual Deployment

To deploy manually:

1. Install dependencies: `pnpm install`
2. Build the site: `pnpm build`
3. Deploy to production: `pnpm deploy`
4. Or deploy to development environment: `pnpm deploy:dev`

### Environment-specific URLs

- Production (main branch): `https://docs.zhang.finance`
- Development (develop branch): `https://docs-dev.zhang.finance`

### Configuring Custom Domains

1. In your Cloudflare account, go to Workers & Pages
2. Find your project (`zhang-docs-prod` or `zhang-docs-dev`)
3. Go to the "Custom domains" tab
4. Add your custom domain

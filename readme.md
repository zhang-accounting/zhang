## Quick Start

To quickly get started with Zhang, you can use Docker to install and run the service:

```shell
docker pull kilerd/zhang:latest
docker run --name zhang -v "/your/data/path:/data" -p "8000:8000" kilerd/zhang:latest
```

This will pull the latest Zhang Docker image and run it, exposing the service on port 8000.

## Features

- **Independent Directive**: all directives in zhang are independent, you can write them in any file with any order.
- **More Precise Control**: features, like commodity decimal precision and datetime supported for directive, provide
  more control
- **Document Management Enhancement**: zhang has a good document management feature to allow you collect and control
  document easier and effective, like receipts.
- **New Functionalities**: The latest version introduces enhanced budget management, improved error handling, and
  support for multiple currencies.

### Compatibility with beancount

beancount and zhang are both text based accounting tools, and they are some familiar.

But zhang deprecates some directives, like `note`, `pad` and `push_tag`, and also evolves some directives,
like `balance`. So your beancount file may not be compatible with zhang, we will provide a tool to convert beancount
format to zhang format, and vice versa.
